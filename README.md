# 🚗 ESP32-CAM Smart Surveillance Car

This project demonstrates a **Wi-Fi-controlled smart surveillance car** using the **ESP32-CAM** module. It allows **live video streaming** and **remote flashlight (LED) control** through a custom web interface — no physical buttons required!

## 🔧 Features
- 📷 Live MJPEG video streaming via `/stream`
- 💡 Flashlight control via a web UI (turn LED on/off remotely)
- 📡 Controlled entirely over Wi-Fi
- 📱 Mobile/PC-compatible interface

## 🛠️ Built With
- ESP32-CAM
- Arduino IDE
- HTML/JavaScript (for UI)
- WiFi and HTTP server libraries

## 📌 Use Cases
- Home surveillance
- Rescue robot prototypes
- DIY robotics/IoT learning
- Remote monitoring systems

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Flash the code using Arduino IDE (select ESP32-CAM board)
2. Connect to the same Wi-Fi network
3. Access the ESP32-CAM IP address from your browser
4. View the stream and control the flashlight

## 🧠 Future Scope
- Add motor driver (L298N) for full movement control
- Add sensors for obstacle detection
- Add remote joystick or smartphone app

## 🤝 Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! Let’s build smarter IoT systems together.
